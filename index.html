            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>My name is Meghan Pryce, and I’m a third-year journalism major at the University of Florida. I discovered my love for telling stories while on a study abroad trip to Spain and Greece with the College of Journalism and Communications. I fell in love with a class called video storytelling. I was in a new country, where I didn’t speak the language, with the task of creating a multimedia video. This was all during the summer of my freshman year. After that summer, I knew journalism was the perfect career for me because I loved telling compelling stories. Some of my other interests include photography, technology, travel, entertainment, health and fashion. To be honest, I’m interested in a little bit of everything. I love learning new things. I’m the type of girl that isn’t afraid of a challenge and is always willing to try something new. I’m also very active around campus. I am the Vice President of the Gator Chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists (UF NABJ) and an active member of the Journalism and Communications Ambassadors (JCA). Feel free to take a look around my website, and check out some of my work.</p>
