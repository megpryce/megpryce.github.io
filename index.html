            <h3><em>I'm a web-savy journalist with a slight obsession to pop culture.</em></h3>
            <p>My name is Meghan Pryce, and I’m a third-year journalism major at the <a href="http://www.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>. I’m passionate about digital journalism because I love telling stories in different ways. While I enjoy writing long-form features, breaking news articles and investigative pieces, I also find the pleasure and challenge in using video, audio and social media to narrate a story. I discovered my interest in telling compelling stories while on a study abroad trip to Spain and Greece with the UF <a href="https://www.jou.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">College of Journalism and Communications</a>. I was in a new country, where I didn’t speak the language, with the task of creating a multimedia video. This was all during the summer of my freshman year, and I managed to interview my subject with confidence and created my first video using a point-and-shoot camera. Some of my other interests include photography, technology, travel, entertainment, health and fashion. To be honest, I’m interested in a little bit of everything. I’m not afraid to take on a difficult task, and I’m always willing to try something new. When I’m not in a newsroom or working on a story, you can find me scrolling through news feeds or catching up on my favorite television shows.</p>
