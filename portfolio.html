            <h3>Will new water meters fix Archer residents’ problems?</h3>
            <p>This is an investigative story I wrote with a fellow reporter at WUFT News about inaccurate water meter readings in Archer, Fla. This story involved handling public records, interviewing multiple sources from each point of view and gathering audio for the radio piece. I also assisted with writing and editing the radio script. It took about two weeks to turn this story around, and we were still able to beat a competing television station to the story.</p>

            <h3>A guide to shaving (down there)</h3>
            <p>Fall is officially upon us, but it’s not exactly “No Shave November” just yet. There’s still time to hit the pool and the beach, which means you might want to have your bikini area well-kept. Personally, I find shaving to be a tedious chore, but you can make your shaving experience (down there) a relaxing and spa-like task by following these easy steps.</p>
