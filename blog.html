            <h1>Fiery Females</h1>
            <p>This is a blog I recently created to empower fiery females. I got the idea to create this blog after reading Sheryl Sandberg's "Lean In:  Women, Work, and the Will to Lead." This book is my motivation and the reason why my long-term goal is to earn a leadership position in my field. This blog was also created from a very personal place. Throughout my college career, peers have used adjectives such as bold and fiesty to describe me. Most of the time, my peers would use these words with a negative connotation. People made me feel like being passionate and spirited were bad things. With creating this blog, I decided to embrace that side of myself because being a fiery female is most certainly something to be proud of. My blog shines a light on the bold women making big changes in the media and other feminist issues. Head on over to my <a href="http://fieryfemales.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog's website</a> to take a look.</p>
